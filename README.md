## Assignment Instructions

### Base Mode

On the Secure Submarine, there are many secrets, but our enemies are out to steal our secrets! We just realized that our Secure Submarine web portal (the portal for all of the hottest gossip on the secure submarine) is compromised! Anyone, logged in or not, can visit `http://localhost:5000/api/secrets` to see all of the secrets for the entire crew!

#### No Secrets for the Unauthenticated (Authentication)

> Task: Only users who are authenticated should see any secrets.

The user router is protected from unauthenticated requests thanks to the `rejectUnauthenticated` middleware:

```JavaScript
router.get('/', rejectUnauthenticated, (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.user);
});
```

Do this for the secrets route to achieve these results:

- [ ] An unauthenticated user visiting `http://localhost:5000/api/secrets` should get a `403` or `forbidden` error instead of seeing the secrets.
- [ ] A user like `Admiral Greer` with password `tuna` should still be able to visit `http://localhost:3000/#/secrets` to see all of the secrets.

#### No Secrets Above Clearance Level (Authorization)

> Task: When authenticated, a user should only see secrets with a `secrecy_level` that is equal or less than the user's `clearance_level`.

A user like `Captain Borodin` with password `shark` is be to visit `http://localhost:3000/#/secrets` to see all of the secrets! That's no good! There's a secret in there that calls him weird!

You should see the clearance level in the console log inside of secrets GET request in `secrets.router.js`. Now fix the query in `secrets.router.js` so that it uses the clearance level to determine which secrets to return.

- [ ] A user like `Captain Borodin` with password `shark` should no longer be able to see any secrets above his `clearance_level` which is `10`.
- [ ] A user like `Admiral Greer` with password `tuna` should still be able to visit `http://localhost:3000/#/secrets` to see all of the secrets.

### Stretch Goals

#### Hashing

If you're interested in securely storing passwords, you should salt and hash them. Here is a quick video that explains it pretty well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtInClXe1Q

Right now, we are storing the passwords in plain text, so if the enemy got a hold of our database, they would know everybody's password! Instead of storing plain passwords, we should scramble them up. That is called hashing.

Uncomment this line to start hashing passwords for each user.

```JavaScript
return bcrypt.hashSync(password, '$2b$10$p5Wkte33hlOBOcUtJie6H.');
```

Because the database doesn't store the actual password, we can't just check to see if they are equal like we were doing before. Uncomment this line to allow us to check `candidatePasswords` (what the user entered), against the `storedPassword` (the hash in the database).

```JavaScript
return bcrypt.compareSync(candidatePassword, storedPassword);
```

New users will now have their passwords hashed!

Run these queries to add your users back to the database with hashed passwords:

```SQL
DROP TABLE "user";

CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL,
    "clearance_level" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

INSERT INTO "user" ("username", "password", "clearance_level")
VALUES ('Admiral Greer', '$2b$10$p5Wkte33hlOBOcUtJie6H.PnCvk8v.KjZspVoAFtT7g5v5xK.EXVG', 18),
('Captain Borodin', '$2b$10$p5Wkte33hlOBOcUtJie6H.ZIgFjzr4zY8FItxC8gZyqIWD5gYmL0m', 10),
('Lieutenant Nguyen', '$2b$10$p5Wkte33hlOBOcUtJie6H.vaUd5ikB1LWCbVZAA87BR63NiDorn1C', 4),
('Lieutenant Ryan', '$2b$10$p5Wkte33hlOBOcUtJie6H.PnCvk8v.KjZspVoAFtT7g5v5xK.EXVG', 4);
```

#### Salting
Now that we are no longer storing plain text passwords. The enemy is unable to see the crew's passwords. However, Lieutenant Ryan has been careless, and the enemy knows that his password is `tuna`. Because of this, they can see the lowest security information. Then they notice that Admiral Greer's hashed password perfectly matches Lieutenant Ryan's hashed password! They now know that Admiral Greer's password is `tuna` as well! We should fix our code so that even if two people have the same password, it has a different hash in the database. Enter salting! Salting is the process of generating a random string for each user. Notice that every password starts with `$2b$10$p5Wkte33hlOBOcUtJie6H.`. That is the salt! These should be random and generated uniquely for each user.

Uncomment these two lines to start creating a unique salt for each user.

```JavaScript
const salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync(SALT_WORK_FACTOR); // This generates a random salt
```

```JavaScript
return bcrypt.hashSync(password, salt);
```

New users will now have their passwords salted and hashed!

Run these queries to add your users back to the database with hashed passwords:

```SQL
DROP TABLE "user";

CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL,
    "clearance_level" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

INSERT INTO "user" ("username", "password", "clearance_level")
VALUES ('Admiral Greer', '$2b$10$uxPm0qeJAz70oqhEg8dX6uXlYc2PWUtPuZhTa65OiDv2LCHA41OLq', 18),
('Captain Borodin', '$2b$10$iUCrWSMvLpYuKQLsmmTiNe3gfU6jAdyElCbCLtboVH6DlXJdsuPxG', 10),
('Lieutenant Nguyen', '$2b$10$/3yhbbjXPPf3L4Z1gXDA5OJzJkf6b.2CuvIA8OzP6c8jPEQlbo5re', 4),
('Lieutenant Ryan', '$2b$10$hr1Tlo6K.yxAq3FC4iIHsuYQwYpjQC8SyDnYykMu/LNB9TXMkxMt2', 4);
```

Admiral Greer and Lieutenant Ryan still have the same passwords as before, but it's not easy to see that because of salting and hashing.

#### Create an Environment Variable
`SERVER_SESSION_SECRET` is supposed to be a secret, but right now we are pushing it to GitHub! Let's create an environment variable so that we don't do this.

* Uncomment `// return process.env.SERVER_SESSION_SECRET;` in `session-middleware.js`
* Run `npm install dotenv` to get the node module that can create environment variables
* Add the line `require('dotenv').config();` to the top of `server.js` to use the module
* add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
* Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
    ```
    SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
    ```
    While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/).

---

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `prime_app` and create a `user` table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);
```

If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `prime_app` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js`

## Development Setup Instructions

- Run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
  ```
  While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm run server`
- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Debugging

To debug, you will need to run the client-side separately from the server. Start the client by running the command `npm run client`. Start the debugging server by selecting the Debug button.

![VSCode Toolbar](documentation/images/vscode-toolbar.png)

Then make sure `Launch Program` is selected from the dropdown, then click the green play arrow.

## Testing Routes with Postman

To use Postman with this repo, you will need to set up requests in Postman to register a user and login a user at a minimum.

Keep in mind that once you using the login route, Postman will manage your session cookie for you just like a browser, ensuring it is sent with each subsequent request. If you delete the `localhost` cookie in Postman, it will effectively log you out.

1. Start the server - `npm run server`
2. [Import the sample routes JSON file](./PostmanPrimeSoloRoutes.json) by clicking `Import` in Postman. Select the file.
3. Click `Collections` and `Send` the following three calls in order:
   1. `POST /api/user/register` registers a new user, see body to change username/password
   2. `POST /api/user/login` will login a user, see body to change username/password
   3. `GET /api/user` will get user information, by default it's not very much

After running the login route above, you can try any other route you've created that requires a logged in user!

## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:5000`

## Lay of the Land

There are a few videos linked below that show a walkthrough the client and sever setup to help acclimatize to the boilerplate. Please take some time to watch the videos in order to get a better understanding of what the boilerplate is like.

- [Initial Set](https://vimeo.com/453297271)
- [Server Walkthrough](https://vimeo.com/453297212)
- [Client Walkthrough](https://vimeo.com/453297124)

Directory Structure:

- `src/` contains the React application
- `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
- `build/` after you build the project, contains the transpiled code from `src/` and `public/` that will be viewed on the production site
- `server/` contains the Express App

This code is also heavily commented. We recommend reading through the comments, getting a lay of the land, and becoming comfortable with how the code works before you start making too many changes. If you're wondering where to start, consider reading through component file comments in the following order:

- src/components
  - App/App
  - Footer/Footer
  - Nav/Nav
  - AboutPage/AboutPage
  - InfoPage/InfoPage
  - UserPage/UserPage
  - LoginPage/LoginPage
  - RegisterPage/RegisterPage
  - LogOutButton/LogOutButton
  - ProtectedRoute/ProtectedRoute

## Deployment

1. Create a new Heroku project
1. Link the Heroku project to the project GitHub Repo
1. Create an Heroku Postgres database
1. Connect to the Heroku Postgres database from Postico
1. Create the necessary tables
1. Add an environment variable for `SERVER_SESSION_SECRET` with a nice random string for security
1. In the deploy section, select manual deploy

## Update Documentation

Customize this ReadMe and the code comments in this project to read less like a starter repo and more like a project. Here is an example: https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2
